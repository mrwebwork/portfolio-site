# My Professional Portfolio

This portfolio website, built with Next.js and React, showcases my front-end development skills. It features project showcases, an about section, and a contact form. More features are currently under active development.

## Features

- **Dynamic routing:** Each page of the portfolio is automatically routed based on its file name in the `pages` directory.
- **Reusable components:** Components such as `Header`, `Footer`, and `ProjectCard` are reused across multiple pages, demonstrating DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS and CSS Modules are used for component-level styles, resulting in a clean and organized codebase.
- **Static files:** Static files, like images, are served from the `public` directory.
- **Deployment:** The site is hosted on GitHub Pages, demonstrating knowledge of version control and continuous deployment practices.

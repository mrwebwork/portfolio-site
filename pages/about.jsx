      <Paragraph>
        Graduating from Texas State University with a Bachelor of Business
        Administration in Computer Information Systems was a pivotal point in my
        life, but my journey into the world of technology and teamwork began
        long before college.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        In high school, I discovered my love for strategy and leadership as the
        President of the Chess Club. Harnessing the power of careful planning
        and foresight refined my decision-making skills, something I later
        applied to my web development career. This curiosity about intricate
        systems also led me to establish the Cryptocurrency Club, where I
        navigated the complex world of digital currencies with my peers.

      <Paragraph>
        Sports have also been a crucial part of my life, from basketball and
        football to track and field. As an athlete, I learned the essence of
        teamwork and the significance of representing something larger than
        oneself. The camaraderie and competition nurtured my resilience and
        collaborative spiritâ€”traits I bring to every project I undertake today.

      <Paragraph>
        As a Software Engineer, I bring ideas to life in the digital world. With
        a rich experience in platforms like Shopify and WordPress, and
        proficiency in HTML5, CSS3, SASS, JavaScript, React.js, and Next.js. I
        craft user-friendly interfaces for an exceptional online experience.
        Collaborating seamlessly with back-end developers, my aim is to create
        dynamic and responsive websites. My passion fuels my continuous
        learning, helping me to deliver top-notch results, on time. Always
        excited for new challenges, I offer my services globally via&nbsp;

      <Paragraph>
        Outside of the digital world, you&apos;ll often find me running along
        the trails of Austin, paddleboarding on the river, or going for
        reflective walks. I believe in maintaining a healthy balance between
        personal growth and professional development.

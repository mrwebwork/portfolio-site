            My journey started at Shopify, where I integrated payment systems
            and boosted site traffic by 40% through SEO strategies. I was
            instrumental in tailoring the e-commerce experience, building custom
            features using Liquid. Then, I dove into freelancing on Fiverr,
            where I&apos;ve delivered 40+ websites with innovative UI/UX
            designs, securing higher conversion rates and customer satisfaction.

          <Paragraph>
            Web development is not just my professionâ€”it&apos;s my passion. The
            thrill of learning new technologies, coupled with my ability to
            collaborate effectively, fuels my drive to create dynamic,
            user-friendly web experiences.
